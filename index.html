        <h3>Video games are generally considered retro if they were made before the 2010's, but this term is used most of the time to describe games made in the 90's and it's a bit lax with the games made in the early 2010's.</h3>
        <h5>This page focuses on the timeline of the most popular and well recognized generations of retro video game consoles along with games that acted as milestones that innovated the genre, up to the modern games we have today. Many of these generations also overlap eachother at some points.</h5>
        <h5>The second page focuses on the pricepoints of getting into retro gaming in specific generations.</h5>

        <P>This video game console generation was the first generation that was accessible for the general public to buy. While this was the second generation of video game consoles in history, it was the first generation of home video game consoles.</P>
        <P>The console of this generation was the Atari 2600, made by a company of the same name, Atari.</P>
        <p>It boasted impresive pixel art for the time and housed well-known classic games like Space Invaders, Donkey Kong, and Frogger pictured below.</p>
        <P>While most of these games can be played online nowadays, this was an extremely impressive graphical and technological feat at the time.</P>
        <P>Sadly, this generation also includes the game E.T. (pictured below). This game was based on the movie of the same name and is wildly regarded as the worst video game ever created. It was games like this that led to the North American video game crash in 1983.</P>
