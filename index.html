        <h3>Video games are generally considered retro if they were made before the 2010's, but this term is used most of the time to describe games made in the 90's and it's a bit lax with the games made in the early 2010's.</h3>
        <h5>This page focuses on the timeline of the most popular and well recognized generations of retro video game consoles along with games that acted as milestones that innovated the genre, up to the modern games we have today. Many of these generations also overlap eachother at some points.</h5>
        <h5>The second page focuses on the pricepoints of getting into retro gaming in specific generations.</h5>

        <h5>This video game console generation was the first generation that was accessible for the general public to buy. While this was the second generation of video game consoles in history, it was the first generation of home video game consoles.</h5>
        <h5>The console of this generation was the Atari 2600 (pictured below), made by a company of the same name, Atari.</h5>

        <h5>It boasted impresive pixel art for the time and housed well-known classic games like Space Invaders, Donkey Kong, and Frogger.</h5>
        <h5>While most of these games can be played online nowadays, this console's library of games were an extremely impressive graphical and technological feat at the time.</h5>
        <h5>Sadly, this generation also includes the game E.T. (pictured below). This game was based on the movie of the same name and is wildly regarded as the worst video game ever created. It was games like this that led to the North American video game crash in 1983.</h5>

        <h5>This video game console generation, dominated by the Super Nintendo Entertainment System made by Nintendo (SNES for short-pictured below), was a bit of an in-between generation.</h5>

        <h5>Despite those amazing games, this was mainly a generation that improved on past games while biding time for the future. The progress that was made here was substantial, and it was used to further improve the generations that came after.</h5>

        <h5>The first well known innovative game on the Playstation was a game that was to be the first in a series that is now known extremely well in the gaming community, Resident Evil (pictured below). This game is also known as Biohazard in Japan, it's country of origin.</h5>

        <h5>This video game console generation is home to the Playstation 2, made by Sony (pictured below). It's the video game console with the highest sales in history, due to it's backwards compatibility with the original Playstation and it's ability to play DVD's.</h5>

        <h5>It's also home to Resident Evil 4 (pictured below), which, unlike E.T., is considered one of, if not the best, video games ever made. It inovated camera angles, pretty much inventing the modern third person camera we have today, and melded the horror and action genres together in a way that hasn't been able to be replicated in video games even now, 17 years later. There's rumours floating around about a Remake being announced early this year for a long time, and I hope the remake lives up to all the fans expectations when we finally get an official announcement from Capcom.</h5>
